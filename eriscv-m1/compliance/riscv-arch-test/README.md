# eRISCV-M1 ACT4 Profile

This is the sole architectural-test flow for eRISCV-M1 MCU verification. The
base profile selects `I`, `M`, `Zca`, `Zicsr`, `Zifencei`, `Zicntr`, `Zihpm`, and `Zihintpause`. A fresh reference build imports the two `Zihpm` artifacts. `build_u.sh` adds the U-mode, PMPU/MPRV, and `ZicntrU` selection (12
artifacts). UDB represents the RV32C base through `Zca`.

ACT4 artifacts are local, reproducible cache under:

```text
eriscv-m1/compliance/riscv-arch-test/generated/
```

The cache contains instruction `.mem`, optional `.data.mem`, and `.act.json`
manifests. It is ignored by Git. The pinned `riscv-arch-test` submodule remains
the source of the ACT assembly.

ACT4 build work is kept in `work/` and `work-pmp/`; shared tool caches are kept in `.cache/act4/`. Both locations are ignored by Git. The Sail reference configuration maps a 256 KiB executable test-harness window so generated ACT code and its startup shim fit; this is not the product's fixed 64 KiB IMEM contract.

The core testbench separately preserves the physical 64 KiB IMEM contract.

Rebuild the cache when needed:

```bash
make act-generate-m1
```

Set up the required ACT4 tools first using the repository-level
[ACT4 instructions](../../../README.md#generate-act4-artifacts-optional).
Native hosts use `make ACT_BOOTSTRAP_ARGS=--all act-bootstrap-native` once,
then this target. `make act-generate-m1-container` is the Docker fallback.

## PMP subset

`build_pmp.sh` generates only ACT4's M-mode PMP family (`PMPSm`) using the
16-entry, 4-byte-granularity product declaration. It does not select S-mode,
U-mode, virtual-memory, atomics, cache-block, or Smepmp-dependent PMP tests.
The UDB `Sm` marker models M-mode privileged behavior only; it does not expand
the eRISCV-M1 product contract. `pmpsm_cfg_A_tor_zero` is excluded because
its Sail reference run jumps to unmapped address zero, a platform assumption
outside this MCU memory map.

The core TB supports DBUS reads and byte writes only in its executable IMEM
window (`0x0000_0000..0x0003_ffff`). PMPSm payloads outside that window need a
SoC executable-memory map or an explicitly compatible core harness. They are
not product unified-memory evidence and are excluded from the default core-TB
selection.

```bash
eriscv-m1/compliance/riscv-arch-test/build_pmp.sh
```

## U-mode subset

`build_u.sh` imports ACT4's U-mode, U-mode exception/interrupt, PMPU, and
`ZicntrU` tests into the shared generated corpus. The profile includes the
MPRV PMPU checks and counter-delegation tests; Sail and UDB declare the same
seven writable `mcounteren` bits (CY, TM, IR, and HPM3..6).

Payload-executing PMPU tests declare `exec_data_mirror` in their generated
manifests so the core-only split-memory TB mirrors only their writable execution
payload into IMEM. Dated results are in the
[MCU Evidence Snapshot](../../../docs/Verification/eriscv-mcu-simulation-evidence-snapshot.md).

```bash
eriscv-m1/compliance/riscv-arch-test/build_u.sh
