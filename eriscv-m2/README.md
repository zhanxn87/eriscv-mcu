# eRISCV-M2

`eriscv-m2` is the cacheless performance MCU product. Its frozen contract is
`RV32IMFC_Zicsr_Zifencei_Zicntr_Zihpm_Zihintpause_Zba_Zbb_Zbs_Zcf` (standard B) with `ilp32f`, M/U modes, the common 32-source PLIC
v1.0.0 and Debug 1.0 Minimal platform, and the common 16-entry PMP
contract.

It adds a faster core, single-precision FPU, ITCM/DTCM, shared System SRAM,
and a single generic DMA channel. The channel supports direct System
SRAM-to-System SRAM copies, 32-byte linked descriptors, and a fixed UART0 TX
byte-stream endpoint; UART RX, SPI, and Timer endpoints remain deferred. It
deliberately uses directly addressed memories rather than any cache mechanism.
B is implemented as Zba/Zbb/Zbs; Zbc, D, and Zfa are deferred. The FPU uses a pinned, product-local CVFPU
snapshot with one documented M2-local FMA underflow correctness patch; it is
therefore not an unmodified top-level third-party dependency. See the
[CVFPU vendor lock](rtl/vendor/cvfpu/LOCK.md) for provenance and scope.

regression entry point. FPGA implementation and physical-board status are
separate evidence; see [the family documentation map](../docs/README.md).
